# CannonConfigure

A small, flexible ./configure script built for small projects

## Why Is This a Thing?

Most or all of my projects at the moment use CMake as their default build system. While CMake is great, and provides a load of options to choose from when creating a project, it also requires that anyone else who wishes to build the software also have a copy of CMake. This script was written with the intention of removing that barrier to people who may not have administration rights needed to fully install CMake, and for people who are casually interested in minimalist projects to compile on their own POSIX-like systems.
